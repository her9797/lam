/**
 * Regression guard for the whole-branch review finding that i18n covered
 * only the app shell while every feature page was hardcoded Korean.
 *
 * Rule: no source file under `features/` may contain a Hangul character
 * outside a comment. Copy belongs in `i18n/resources.ts` and reaches the UI
 * through `t()`; a new page added with zero i18n coverage fails here rather
 * than shipping Korean-only.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT covered, and why:
 *   - `app/**` route `metadata` (page `<title>`s) and `app/api/**` JSON error
 *     bodies are rendered on the server, which cannot know the operator's
 *     language: this app resolves the locale in the browser, from
 *     `localStorage`. Those stay Korean until a locale-in-URL scheme exists.
 *   - Test files, which assert against the Korean (default) rendering.
