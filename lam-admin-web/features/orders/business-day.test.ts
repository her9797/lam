// All Date values in this file are constructed with the local-time
// constructor (`new Date(y, m, d, h, ...)`), and the module under test also
// reads local wall-clock time (`getHours()`/`getDate()`). Both therefore
// agree regardless of the machine's actual system timezone running the
// test — there is nothing here that depends on truly being KST. In
// production, the "local" clock is the operator's own device (expected to
// be set to Korea time), which is exactly the assumption `business-day.ts`
// documents.
