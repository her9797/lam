/**
 * The order-history screen's date-range presets are anchored to the venue's
 * business day, not the calendar day: a bar/lounge's "today" runs from
 * evening into the small hours, so a calendar-midnight boundary would
 * arbitrarily split one night's orders in half.
 *
 * The nominal hours are 18:00-04:00, but per the operator's own guidance
 * ("영업일은 혹시 모르니 앞뒤로 2시간 일찍 또는 연장해서 진행해줘") the boundary is
 * buffered two hours on each side — 16:00 open, 06:00 close — so an
 * occasional early open or a night that runs long still lands in the
 * correct business day instead of spilling into the next one.
 *
 * All computation here reads the local wall-clock time (`Date`'s
 * local-time accessors), matching the operator's own device clock — this
 * module is meant to run in the browser, not on the server, precisely so
 * no server-side timezone policy is needed (see `lam-api`'s
 * `formatTimestamp`, which stores/serializes everything in UTC).
