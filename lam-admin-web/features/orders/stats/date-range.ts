/**
 * Converts the sales-stats screen's two `<input type="date">` values
 * (`YYYY-MM-DD`, no time) into the absolute `[from, to)` instant range
 * `GET /api/v1/admin/payment-orders/stats` expects — under whichever
 * `DayBasis` the operator has selected for the screen.
 *
 * "calendar" treats each picked date as a plain midnight-to-midnight day.
 * "business" treats it as the venue's buffered business day (16:00-06:00,
 * see `../business-day.ts`) that *opens* on that date — the same
 * convention the order-history screen's date presets use, and for the
 * same reason: a bar/lounge's day runs from evening into the small hours,
 * so a calendar-midnight boundary would arbitrarily split one night's
 * orders in half.
 *
 * Parsing happens in the browser, against the operator's own local clock,
 * for the same reason `business-day.ts` does: it keeps `lam-api` free of
 * any server-side timezone policy for filtering.
