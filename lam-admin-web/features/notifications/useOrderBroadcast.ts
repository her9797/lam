/**
 * Subscribes to the public `admin-orders` Broadcast channel and
 * invalidates `orderKeys.all` on every `new_order` signal, so a sale that
 * completes while the operator is looking at the order list (or anywhere
 * else in the admin web) shows up without a manual refresh.
 *
 * Deliberately a separate hook and channel from `useRequestBroadcast`
 * rather than another event on `admin-requests`: customer requests and
 * payment orders are separate flows with separate caches, and neither
 * should invalidate the other's.
 *
 * The signal carries no order data — the callback only triggers a refetch
 * through the existing BFF-backed queries, it never reads the broadcast
 * payload itself. That matters more here than for requests: order rows
 * carry payment details, and this channel is public.
 *
 * A no-op when Supabase isn't configured (`getSupabaseClient()` returns
 * `null`), matching `lam-api`'s send-side "disabled" behavior — local
 * development without a Supabase project keeps working, just at the pace
 * of the notification query's own safety-net poll.
