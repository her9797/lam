 * for the 60s safety-net poll (`features/requests/queries.ts`) — see
 * `docs/plans/2026-09-04-admin-request-notifications.md` sections 3-4.3.
 *
 * The signal carries no request data (public, content-free channel, per
 * section 4.2) — the callback only triggers a refetch through the existing
 * BFF-backed query, it never reads the broadcast payload itself.
 *
 * A no-op when Supabase isn't configured (`getSupabaseClient()` returns
 * `null`), matching `lam-api`'s send-side "disabled" behavior so local
 * development without a Supabase project keeps working — the 60s poll
 * alone still delivers the notification, just slower.
