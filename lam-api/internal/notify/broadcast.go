// Package notify sends a best-effort Supabase Realtime Broadcast signal
// after something the admin web needs to see happens — a customer request
// is created, or a payment order is completed — so the admin web can react
// faster than its 60s safety-net poll (see
// docs/plans/2026-09-04-admin-request-notifications.md section 3-4.3).
//
// Broadcast is a public, content-free channel: the signal never carries the
// request's or order's data, only that something happened. The channel and
// event names here (RequestsTopic/NewRequestEvent, OrdersTopic/
// NewOrderEvent) must match exactly what lam-admin-web's client subscribes
// to.
